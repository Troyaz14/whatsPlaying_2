    <string name="Awesome">Female bodybuilding originally developed as an outgrowth of not only the late nineteenth-century European vaudeville and circus strongwomen acts, Bernarr Macfaddens turn of the century womens physique competitions, and the weightlifting of Abbye Pudgy Stockton, but also as an outgrowth of the mens bodybuilding. The contest formats of mens events during the 1950s to the mid-1970s had often been supplemented with either a womens beauty contest or bikini show. These shows had little to do with womens bodybuilding as we know it today, but they did serve as beginning or, perhaps more properly, as a doormat for the development of future bodybuilding shows.</string>
